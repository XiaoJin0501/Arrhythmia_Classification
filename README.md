# Arrhythmia Classification
## CAT-Net: Convolution, attention, and transformer based network for single-lead ECG arrhythmia classification
by-**Md Rabiul Islam**, PhD Student, TAMU.

# Task At A Glance
Assalamu Alaikum. A CNN, attention and transformer based efficient hybrid model is developed to classify 5 classes of arrhythmias using single-lead ECG signals.
1. Task: Arrhythmia Classification - 5 Class
2. Input: ECG Signal (Actually ECG Heartbeats)
3. Output: Arrhythmia Class
4. Class Balancing Approach: 3 techniques (SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, ADASYN) implemented - Finally SMOTE-Tomek is applied
5. Datasets: 2, (1) MIT-BIH, (2) INCART


## **Main Parts of the Study:** 

1.   **Part A: Installing Packages and Basic Visualization of ECG**
2.   **Part B: Denoising, R-Peak Detection, Segmentation**
3.   **Part C: Dataset Loading**
4.   **Part D: Train-Test Splitting and Class Balancing**
5.   **Part E: Model Building and Training**
6.   **Part F: Results**
