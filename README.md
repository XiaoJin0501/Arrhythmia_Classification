# Arrhythmia Classification
## An Efficient CNN-LSTM and Attention-based Hybrid Model for Single-Lead ECG Arrhythmia Classification

Assalamu Alaikum. A CNN-LSTM and attention based efficient hybrid model is developed to classify 5 classes of arrhythmias using single-lead ECG signals. The model achieved **99.12% accuracy** with a macro **F1 score of 94.39%** using MIT-BIH public dataset. 

## **Main Parts of the Study:** 

1.   **Part A: Installing Packages and Basic Visualization of ECG**
2.   **Part B: Denoising, R-Peak Detection, Segmentation**
3.   **Part C: Dataset Loading**
4.   **Part D: Train-Test Splitting and Class Balancing**
5.   **Part E: Model Building and Training**
6.   **Part F: Results**
